1. **Gets Canvas Courses**  
   1. **Organize it by Active/Inactive, then organize those by enrollment date or alphabetically?**  
2. **Prompt user (which course)**  
   1. **Users can choose multiple courses**  
      1. **The order they choose the courses determines project priority**  
   2. **User can also decide how many projects get created (alongside an estimated generation time…?)**  
   3. **User decides if they have a project to attack their shortcomings, or a project that builds their strengths**  
      1. **User can also directly tell the AI what kind of projects they are looking for via text prompt**  
   4. **User chooses the difficulty range of the project they choose**  
   5. **User chooses the duration range of the project they choose**  
3. **AI figures out the project criteria from the selected course**  
   1. **Looks at…**  
      1. **Syllabus (maybe)**  
      2. **Assigned Assignments (to see where they are in the course)**  
      3. **Graded Rubrics and/or Instructor Feedback**  
      4. **Student Submissions**  
   2. **The AI Avoids…**  
      1. **The assignment instructions themselves**  
      2. **Teacher-provided resources**  
      3. **Anything else that is not directly related to the user’s own work**  
4. **AI searches for projects to use as inspiration**  
   1. **Steps:**  
      * **The AI decides what skills the project should focus on building**  
        1. **The order of the courses directly influences what skills are involved in the final project**  
        * **The AI looks for projects that might involve the chosen skills**  
        * **The AI takes all the projects into a different prompt to modify and remix them to involve the skills chosen by the AI in step 1, giving priority to the skills ordered first in the course list.**   
          1. **However, all skills must be involved in some capacity**  
        * **The AI breaks the project into separate deliverables and defines what the user should achieve by X date via a rubric(?)**  
          1. **Each deliverable should highlight what skills need to be used from which courses, as well as the rationale for why (important for step 5\)**  
          2. **If the step involves information that the user hasn’t learned, the AI must find documentation and tutorials that help the user fill the gaps in their knowledge**  
          3. **Each deliverable also must contain the deliverable’s expected difficulty and expected duration, and provide context-relevant proof as to why they made that choice (important for step 5\)**  
        * **The AI’s result gets fed into a different AI that validates the AI’s reasoning and filters any generated projects that don’t apply to the project**  
          1. **If the project is terrible, the result is dropped and the AI must go back to step 2 and regenerate a new project**  
             1. **These projects can still be seen by the user, but they are hidden by default and the user has to go out of their way to find them**  
          2. **If the project has only a few issues, the AI must make the necessary changes and resubmit it for review.**  
        * **The Validator AI sorts the projects by how relevant they are, and returns it to the program**  
5. **AI gives the final product to user**  
6. **User selects a project, or reprompts the AI and it goes back to step 3**  
   1. **If the User Reprompts the AI, it goes back to step 3**  
   2. **If the User selects a project, the project gets saved to some kind of project library**  
      1. **This “Project library” is just where the user can view all the projects that they have interest in starting. The user can organize each project in the project library into these fields:**  
         * **“Interested/Not Started”**  
         * **“In Progress”**  
           1. **This field would then be organized by deliverable due date**  
         * **“Finished”**  
         * **“Dropped/Postponed”**
